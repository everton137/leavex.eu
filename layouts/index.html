        <p>
            Since Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter (now X), the platform has increasingly undermined democratic principles. Its algorithms now favor divisive rhetoric and amplify individual interests over fairness and accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
            European leaders have the power to set an example by leaving X and fostering trust through decentralized, open communication channels. By abandoning X, they can protect democracy and uphold the values of transparency and inclusivity.
