Despite repeated warnings about X’s growing moderation failures, disinformation risks, and instability, many Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) continue to rely on the platform for public communication. To better understand this landscape, we compiled a dataset of [all current MEPs](/politicians) and checked whether they still have an account on X.

The tables below show two rankings based on this data:
(1) by country, highlighting where representatives remain most active on X, and
(2) by EU political group, showing which groups still rely heavily on the platform.

These rankings are based on the proportion of each group’s members who continue to use X, not just absolute numbers, offering a clearer picture of where platform dependency remains strongest within the Parliament.

If you know of an inactive politician, we would be glad to update the statistics. Contact us  [leavex@pm.me](mailto:leavexeu%40pm.me?subject=Ideas%20for%20Leave%20X), [@leavex@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@leavex), or [@leavex.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/leavex.eu), and inform us of the X handle. If an MEP has declared that they quit X, we would appreciate an https://archive.is link to their post.
