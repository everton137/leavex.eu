The argument that you can't leave platforms like X or TikTok because there would otherwise be a lack of “dissent” and “opposition” is untenable for several reasons - it's simply complete bullshit. It is based on a false assumption about how these platforms work and what impact one's presence there actually has.

## 1. The myth of the “necessary opposition”
The idea that disinformation and hate can only be combated through direct counter-speech on these platforms assumes that genuine, fair discourse takes place there. But that is precisely not the case. The algorithms of these platforms are optimized to maximize engagement/attention - and this is most effectively done through polarization, anger and controversy. Opposition is amplified not because it is particularly effective, but because it creates conflict that triggers more interaction.

In other words: Those who argue against disinformation on these platforms paradoxically contribute to the further dissemination of precisely this content. Contradiction is not treated as a corrective, but as fuel for the spread of disinformation.

## 2 The influence of the algorithm: no neutral stage
The platforms are not neutral places where “good” and “bad” arguments simply meet and are debated. They are profit-oriented companies that specifically align the algorithm to amplify what triggers interaction - and that is often extreme, polarizing and emotionally charged content.

Even if someone “disagrees”, the argument alone ensures that the algorithm classifies the original post as relevant and plays it out to even more users. In other words, you increase the reach of content that you actually reject.

## 3. Do you really capitulate when you leave?
Another common misconception is that leaving such platforms is a kind of capitulation - an admission that hate has won. The opposite is true. Those who stay play by the platform operators' rules and feed their business model with attention and data. Those who leave deprive them of this resource.

Truly meaningful opposition does not arise within an environment that is inherently manipulative, but where people can communicate in a self-determined way. The [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) or other decentralized platforms offer better conditions for this because they are not dependent on profit through outrage engagement.

## 4. Conclusion: The only winning strategy is to do without
The idea that opposition to X or TikTok is indispensable is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how these platforms work. You strengthen what you want to fight. Instead of continuing to fight against a manipulative algorithm, it is more effective in the long term to use alternatives that enable real discourse - and thus reduce the influence of the platforms instead of unintentionally promoting it further.

As soon as politicians and the media stop using these platforms and no longer classify them as relevant, they deprive the operators of their most important resource: attention. Without this attention, there is no basis for activity and engagement on the platforms. The algorithm, which relies on constant interaction, loses its driving force and can no longer disseminate content as effectively. By withdrawing from this system, you reduce the reach of the platforms and significantly weaken their business model.

The problem is that many people don't realize this and continue to unconsciously remain part of this system. They think their presence on the platforms is necessary to combat disinformation or spread their opinions - without realizing that they are doing exactly what the algorithm and the tech bros intend. By continuing to interact, comment and share, they are strengthening the system they actually oppose. They are contributing to the spread of content that supports the platforms' business model instead of weakening it. This vicious circle can only be broken by consciously withdrawing and withdrawing attention. But as long as many continue to believe that their presence and activity on these platforms is “important”, the system will keep running.
