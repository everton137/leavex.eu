As symbolic prize for democratic leadership, we are creating **The Leave X Peer Persuasion Award**. More than [four hundred Members](/politicians) of the European Parliament (MEPs) are still active on X, which corresponds to nearly 60% of the total.

We believe that defending democracy requires more than just laws and regulations; it also requires personal responsibility, peer influence, and setting a good example.

For this reason, we are announcing this award to recognize MEPs who actively p*ersuade their colleagues to leave X* and explain publicly why this matters for democracy.

This is not a competition for visibility; rather, it is an acknowledgment of democratic leadership.

### The Challenge

From January 18, 2026, to April 18, 2026, any MEP may participate by:

1. Persuading one or more fellow MEPs to leave X, through direct discussion, argumentation, or example.
1. Publicly documenting the process on a personal or institutional website or alternative social media platforms, such as Mastodon.
1. Clearly naming the colleagues who decided to leave X because of this persuasion with their consent.

Transparency matters; the goal is to demonstrate how peer-to-peer democratic leadership works in practice.

### The Prizes:

Three prizes will be awarded to the MEPs who demonstrate the greatest peer impact.

#### 🥇 First Prize:

**How Democracies Die**, by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt

Awarded for outstanding leadership in defending democratic norms through persuasion and example.

#### 🥈 Second Prize:

**The Age of Surveillance Capitalism**, by Shoshana Zuboff

Awarded for highlighting the structural risks that platform power poses to democracy and civic autonomy.

#### 🥉 Third Prize:

**On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century**, by Timothy Snyder.

Awarded for moral clarity and historical awareness in defending democratic values.

The prizes are valuable not for their material reward, but for what they represent.

#### How to Participate

- Publish on some alternative social media, for instance, Mastodon, or on your website, the list of MEPs you have convinced to leave X.
- Explain your arguments and reasoning.
- List the colleagues who left X following your persuasion.
- Share a link with us at [leavexeu@pm.me](mailto:leavexeu%40pm.me?subject=Ideas%20for%20Leave%20X), or [@leavex@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@leavex).

We will review submissions after 18 April 2026 and publicly announce the recipients and send the prizes to the European Parliament in Brussels.

Democratic cheers,
