This website serves as the central platform for hosting **#LeaveX**, [An Open Letter to All European Politicians and Leaders to Abandon X/Twitter](/letter), written on 06 January 2025, along with translations into various official European languages. A [petition](https://openpetition.eu/leavex) created to support the letter gathered **3,230 signatures** across Europe before closing.

The letter articulates the core message and reasoning behind this initiative. For a deeper reflection on why remaining on social networks "to provide opposition" is a flawed argument, you may also read: [Why the argument that you have to stay on social networks to provide opposition is complete nonsense](../posts/why-stay-on-social-media-makes-no-sense/).

However, the vision extends far beyond online engagement. Through this platform, we aim to:

* **Connect with like-minded groups, movements, and individuals** who share a commitment to protecting democracy and promoting transparent, ethical communication.
* **Contact politicians and leaders directly** to advocate for meaningful action.
* **Gather in-person signatures** to demonstrate widespread support.
* **Raise awareness** of the dangers of _disinformation campaigns_ and their impact on democratic societies.
