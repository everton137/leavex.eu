## What, why and who

### What is *Leave X*?

'*Leave X - Protect Democracy*' is a citizen-led initiative that raises awareness about the role of disinformation platforms in undermining democratic societies.

The project hosts *#LeaveX*, an [open letter to European politicians and leaders](/letter) calling on them to abandon X/Twitter. A supporting [petition](https://openpetition.eu/leavex) gathered **3,230 signatures** across Europe before closing.

In addition, the website collects and publishes data on the continued use of X by political representatives across different European countries.


### Why focus on X (formerly Twitter)?

We believe that democratic politics depends on *open, accountable, and civilized public **dialogue***. X no longer provides an environment that supports these values.

Politicians’ continued presence on X has concrete consequences:

- Statements made on X are routinely *amplified by traditional media*.
- Citizens and journalists are effectively *forced onto the platform* in order to follow their representatives.
- The platform has become associated with *disinformation, harassment, and hate speech*.
- Platform governance decisions increasingly *conflict with democratic norms and public accountability*.

When elected officials choose to remain on such platforms, they indirectly legitimize and normalize them.

### Who is behind this initiative?

I am Everton Zanella Alvarenga, a software engineer working at the intersection of open-source, public-interest technology, and civic tech.

Over the past two decades, I have led and contributed to international initiatives focused on transparency, digital rights, and democratic participation. This project is developed in my spare time.

From the beginning, *Leave X – Protect Democracy* has been an *open-source and collaborative effort*. Contributors help by reviewing translations of the [open letter](/letter), sharing data about political representatives in their countries, and improving the website itself.

## General Questions

### What does it mean to be “active” on X?

A politician is considered '*active on X*' if they have an account and there is **no public statement** indicating that they have left the platform.

This applies even if the account has not posted recently.

If a politician wishes to be listed as *inactive* or '*eXited*,' we require a **verifiable public statement** (for example, a post on your social media or an official announcement).

Such confirmation can be sent by email to [leavexeu@pm.me](mailto:leavexeu%40pm.me?subject=Ideas%20for%20Leave%20X) or via [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@leavex).  
The statement will be published as a reference for transparency.

### Where does your data come from?

Our data is collected primarily through:

- [Automated scrapers](https://github.com/everton137/leavex-tools)
- Official websites
- Public API endpoints

We aim for accuracy, but errors or outdated information can occur. If you notice missing or incorrect data, please contact us by email or via Mastodon.

Corrections are welcome and encouraged.

### Is this a partisan or party-political initiative?

No. *Leave X - Protect Democracy* is *non-partisan*.

The initiative does not endorse political parties or candidates. It focuses exclusively on the *structural risks posed by **disinformation platforms*** and the responsibility of public office holders to communicate in ways that uphold democratic values.

### Are you telling politicians to stop using social media altogether?

No. The initiative does **not** argue against social media as such.

It calls for politicians to *leave a specific platform* whose current governance, incentive structures, and moderation practices actively harm democratic discourse. And we propose using [alternative channels](/posts/concrete-european-alternatives-to-x/) that better support transparency and accountability.

### Shouldn’t I stay on social networks to "provide opposition"?

This argument is often presented as a reason to remain on harmful platforms. We disagree.

Our core reasoning is explained in detail in [Why the argument that you have to stay on social networks to provide opposition is complete nonsense](/posts/why-stay-on-social-media-makes-no-sense/).

In short, remaining on such platforms often amplifies them, legitimizes their role in public discourse, and forces democratic debate to take place on infrastructures that are neither neutral nor accountable.


### Why focus only on X?

We agree that other large social media platforms, such as Facebook (Meta), TikTok, and others, also pose serious problems for democratic discourse.

This campaign *focuses on X* because it plays a unique role in political communication. Statements published on X are frequently quoted and amplified by traditional media outlets, including by organizations and individuals who have already left the platform themselves.

As a result, X continues to *shape public debate* far beyond its own user base, making political disengagement from the platform both urgent and symbolically important.
