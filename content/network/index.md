A space to connect with like-minded groups, movements, and individuals who share a commitment to protecting democracy and promoting transparent, ethical communication.

### Initiatives

* [**EscapeX**](https://escape-x.org): the international campaign *#EscapeX* aims at encouraging individuals, institutions, media outlets, and policymakers to transition from the platform X to more democratic and decentralized digital spaces like MAstodon and Bluesky. The initiative, supported by various initiatives across Europe, promotes data portability and helps users re-establish their social connections on these alternative platforms using the app [OpenPortability](https://openportability.org). In France, over 34,000 users have joined the application, restoring more than 340,000 connections. The campaign is backed by some of the initiatives listed here from countries like France, Spain, Germany, and Italy, collectively advocating for a digital space that fosters democratic debate, neutral algorithms, effective content moderation, and independence from billionaire influence. (International)
* [**Save Social**](https://savesocial.eu/en): About 100 actors from culture, economy and media have joined together to form the initiative Save Social. It advocates for alternative social media platforms to protect democracy, freedom of expression and digital rights. It calls for transparent, accountable platforms free from corporate monopolies and proposes policy solutions such as publicly funded alternatives, algorithmic transparency, and stronger regulation to prevent manipulation and disinformation. They propose platforms based on *open and recognized standards* in *decentralized structures* that foster social exchange and debate. You can support them through their [petition](https://weact.campact.de/petitions/save-social-soziale-netzwerke-als-demokratische-kraft-retten). (Germany)
* [**HelloQuitX**](https://www.helloquitx.com): The *#HelloQuitX* movement advocates for leaving X to combat the platform's harmful influence on public discourse and democracy. It calls on individuals, organizations, and governments to prioritize ethical, transparent, and inclusive digital spaces, urging collective action to reject platforms fostering disinformation, polarization, and corporate control over communication. By quitting X, the movement seeks to inspire healthier online interactions and a more democratic digital future. (France)
* [**BAN X in Europe**](https://ban-x-in.eu): the initiative advocates for restricting X in the European Union due to its role in spreading disinformation, amplifying hate speech, and undermining democratic values. The platform, under Elon Musk’s ownership, has weakened content moderation, reinstated extremist accounts, and engaged in regulatory defiance. This project raises awareness of these issues and calls for policymakers to take action in enforcing stricter regulations or banning the platform if necessary. Check out their [petition](https://www.change.org/p/ban-x-in-europe-elon-musk-must-be-stopped-in-eu). (Italy)
* [**Bye Bye, Elon**](https://byebyeelon.de): as a protest against increasing hate speech on X, 51 organizations from the environmental, human rights, social, health and agricultural sectors are jointly leaving the social media platform with the campaign *#ByeByeElon*. (Germany)
* [**#DetoX**](https://campagnes.degoedezaak.org/campaigns/detox): The *Detox Campaign* by DeGoedeZaak urges Dutch institutions and organizations to stop using advertising on harmful social media platforms like X/Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. By redirecting their advertising budgets to ethical alternatives, the campaign aims to combat the spread of disinformation, hate speech, and polarizing content that undermines democracy and societal trust. (Netherlands)
* [**#MakeSocialsSocialAgain**](https://makesocialssocialagain.nl): This campaign advocates for authentic, user-driven interactions on social media, urging people to reclaim digital spaces from manipulative algorithms and commercial exploitation, while rejecting platforms like X that amplify harmful behaviors. (Netherlands)
* [**#juntas**](https://vamonosjuntas.org): *Vámonos juntas* is a collective of organizations, groups, and individuals advocating for a stronger and more inclusive [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), rooted in values like cooperation, autonomy, sustainability, and respect for open digital communities. The initiative envisions a more humane internet free from monopolies, invasive algorithms, and unwanted advertising, promoting authentic connections and diversity. (Spain)
* [**TwitterExodus**](https://www.twitterexodus.org): the project encourages users to leave Twitter/X and transition to [_Bluesky_](https://bsky.app/profile/thetwitterexodus.bsky.social), highlighting concerns about disinformation, hate speech, and the platform’s lack of accountability. It provides practical guidance on *why* and *how* to migrate, helping users maintain engagement while embracing a more open and user-driven digital space. As a symbolic act, the movement suggests mass departures on Elon Musk’s 55th birthday, June 28, 2026. (USA)
* [**X-odus**](https://github.com/ccamara/X-odus): A list of relevant organizations that have decided to break relationships with X and have made a public statement.
* [**LeaveX**](/about): The *#LeaveX* initiative calls on European politicians and leaders to abandon X in defense of democracy. Through an open letter, accompanied by a [petition](https://openpetition.eu/leavex) and translated into multiple languages, it highlights the platform's role in amplifying disinformation, hate speech, and polarization. (Germany)
