* [**HelloQuitX**](https://www.helloquitx.com): The **#HelloQuitX** movement advocates for leaving X to combat the platform's harmful influence on public discourse and democracy. It calls on individuals, organizations, and governments to prioritize ethical, transparent, and inclusive digital spaces, urging collective action to reject platforms fostering disinformation, polarization, and corporate control over communication. By quitting X, the movement seeks to inspire healthier online interactions and a more democratic digital future. (France)
